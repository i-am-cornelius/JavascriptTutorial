# Javascript Tutorial

I taught this Javascript tutorial back in 2021, and since then I haven't used Js for any project, unless for implementing some data structures and algorithms(something I really love to do). This is 2024 I believe you will still find it as useful as it was almost 4 years ago probably with minor changes due to updates to the language. I added the comprehensive Error handling, Currying, Hoisted functions, Asynchronous programming lessons to the tutorial in 2025. Happy learning!
